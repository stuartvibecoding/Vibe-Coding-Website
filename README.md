## üìù Base Prompt for Vibe Coding Website

This project is built by sharing prompts for each webpage and component. Below is the initial base prompt for the home page. As we build more pages and components, their prompts will be added here for reference and collaboration.

---

### Home Page Initial Prompt

You are building the home page for a Next.js 15 (App Router) project.

Task: Generate `app/page.tsx` (React Server Component) and an optional `app/globals.css` snippet.

Requirements:
1. Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling (assume it‚Äôs already set up).
2. Structure:
‚Ä¢ **Hero** section: full-width, centered text; headline, tagline, one-sentence sub-blurb, and a primary ‚ÄúJoin the Meetup‚Äù button that links to `https://www.meetup.com/stuart-vibe-coding/`.
‚Ä¢ **Mission** section: light background; h2 ‚ÄúOur Mission‚Äù and the mission paragraph below.
‚Ä¢ **What We Do** section: three-column list on `lg:` screens, stacked on mobile.
‚Ä¢ **Why Join?** section: bullet list (ul > li) with subtle left border.
‚Ä¢ **Call to Action** section: centered secondary button ‚ÄúSubscribe for event updates‚Äù (placeholder `#subscribe`).
3. Keep the look clean: generous `py` spacing, max-width container (`max-w-4xl mx-auto`), and a simple gradient (`from-emerald-500 to-teal-500`) behind the hero.
4. Add accessible `aria-label` attributes to both buttons.
5. Make sure all text content exactly matches the copy below (no improvising):
